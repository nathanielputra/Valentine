                HAWOOO,<br> Happy Valentinee Dayy<br> Thankyou for being with me despite of all my absence and weaknesses I really grateful I met you and fortunate that God bring us together!<br>
                I hope we can complement each other even more and be a better person and partner together, with that 
                we can achieve every single one of our goals and dream and be happy together<br>
                Lastly, just for a reminder that you can always be open with me telling everything you feels at a moment without fear to be judged, but of course i will say something if there's anything wrong and please to do so to mee 
                moreover,you dont need to be independent person with me, dont be hesitant asking help to me, and depend on me more because I love it and I didn't fell bothered at all!!
                along with that even if the whole world againts youu i do not care and will still by your side supporting you as much as I can, so dont be afraid to do your things and what you want to do cause there will atleast 1 person !!
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                And still I would be lying if I said I missed you: it's the most perfect, most painful magic, you are here,
                just as I am and even more so; wherever I am, there you are too, and even more intensely<br> -Franz Kafka
